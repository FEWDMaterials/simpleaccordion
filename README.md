# Simple Accordion

YOU ARE TO CREATE A SIMPLE ACCORDION

How it should work...

When user clicks the plus sign, it should become a minue sign and the content
should display
When user clicks the minus sign, it should become a plus sign and the content
should hide


PHASE 1:
    * w/partner: SIMPLY __COMMENT__ out all these lines of code 
      so that you are clear as to what is happening. feel free to console.log
      as you see fit

PHASE 2:
    * this accordion currently does not work
    * using *only* the functions provided (and HTML/CSS) make this accordion work as described above

PHASE 3:
    * force the content to fade in instead of popping in
